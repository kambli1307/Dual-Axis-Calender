Dual Axis is a modern, responsive academic dashboard built to help college students organize their academic life efficiently. It provides a clean interface with sidebar navigation and well-structured sections for tracking daily progress and important academic information.
The dashboard includes Dashboard Overview, Subjects, All Tasks, Schedule, Progress, College Calendar, and Settings. Students can quickly view pending tasks, upcoming deadlines, subject-wise progress, and semester completion status.
A dedicated College Calendar highlights key academic periods such as semester start, internal assessments, practical exams, end-semester exams, and important holidays like Republic Day, making it especially useful for Indian universities.
The project is built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, focusing on responsive design, reusable UI components, smooth hover effects, and a theme-ready structure with Light/Dark mode support through Settings.
